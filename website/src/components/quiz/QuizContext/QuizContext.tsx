            Insurance companies can be attractive targets for cyber criminals
            due to several reasons including:
            {/* <img src= alt="Quiz App Fifty-Fifty example"/> */}
            <ul className="text-indent">
              <li>
                Valuable Data: Insurance companies hold a wealth of sensitive
                data, including personal and financial information about their
                policyholders. This data can be sold on the black market or used
                for identity theft.
              </li>
              <li>
                Financial Transactions: Insurance companies handle large
                financial transactions, which can be attractive for cyber
                criminals looking to intercept these transactions or manipulate
                them for financial gain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Complex Systems: The IT systems of insurance companies can be
                complex and interconnected. This complexity can create security
                vulnerabilities that cyber criminals can exploit.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regulatory Compliance: Insurance companies are subject to
                various regulatory requirements, some of which involve
                maintaining certain data for extended periods. Cyber criminals
                might target this stored data, especially if it’s not adequately
                protected.
              </li>
              <li>
                Third-Party Risk: Insurance companies often work with various
                third parties, such as brokers and healthcare providers. Cyber
                criminals can exploit weak security practices in these third
                parties to gain access to the insurance company’s systems.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s important for insurance companies to have robust cybersecurity
            measures in place to protect against these potential threats. This
            includes regular risk assessments, employee training, data
            encryption, and incident response plans. Using a hypothetical
            business like Sure Safe shows you what is at stake if bad actors
            attack.
